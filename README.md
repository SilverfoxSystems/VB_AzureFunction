# VB_AzureFunction
Azure Function in VB.NET and Framework 4.8

In future, I might upload a version that supports web deploy.

This version outputs libraries which do not need to be uploaded.
To avoid this:
- In *Solution Explorer*, expand *References* and select all items inside 
- Hit the *F4* key to open properties and set the ***Copy Local*** attribute to ***False***
